# bible as interface: reading bible with machines

There are two primary assumptions driving this project. First, our team believes that machines are partners in reading bible. Machines read differently than we do and can teach us things about bible as we read together. Second, we contend that bible is an interface that can afford collaboration and anarchy.  I will expand on these affordances later, but for now, bible as interface simply indicates that bible is made in the encounter between a user and the materiality of the platforms that...

> I refer to bible without the definite article and without capitalization to emphasize that bible is multiple and fluid, constructed as we as users engage with it in interface. 

As an experiment in bible as interface, our EHL and ai.iliff teams are working together to build a conversational AI that will take a bible verse as input and provide some commentary on this verse as output. 


## Theologies of the Digital Workshop 2019

This project is our team's contribution to the international workshop on Theologies of the Digital held in November 2019 at Princeton Theological Seminary. 

### Participants

In this project, our [Experimental Humanities team at Iliff](https://www.iliff.edu/experimental-humanities/) has been a core inspiration and partner in the work at all stages. **Dr. Justin Barber** is the lead AI engineer on the project. **Shawn Goodwin** and **Dr. Micah Saxton** are providing substantial data support for the project. **Dr. Timothy Beal**, co-investigator at ai.iliff, has provided consultation and contributed to writing in the project. To see the active contributors at any stage of the project, you can find this in the [insights area of the repository](https://github.com/iliff/theologiesofthedigital/graphs/contributors). We are also building upon development underway at the [AI Institute at Iliff](https://ai.iliff.edu) and utilizing the excellent high performance computing power provided by the institute. 

I have enabled [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) on all pages of the site. Please feel free to pose questions or thoughts or additional resources or arguments, etc. using the hypothes.is tools. If you are interested in participating in the development of the data or the model used to construct this conversational AI, let us know and we can invite you as a collaborator on the repository. 

> I have struggled for years with the best way to translate the codex afforded "footnotes" into digital writing spaces. For this project, I will include my notes as either indentations within the text of as hypothes.is annotations. Please look for the annotation highlights while you read. Often, the most interesting places for engagement are in the margins, are they not?
